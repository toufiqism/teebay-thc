## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Android Studio**: Latest stable version
- **Minimum SDK**: API 29 (Android 10)
- **Target SDK**: API 36
- **Kotlin**: 2.2.0

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Teebay-THC
   ```

2. Open in Android Studio

3. Sync the project with Gradle files

4. Run the application on device/emulator

### Usage

#### Product Management Flow
1. **View Your Products**: Access "My Products" screen after login
2. **Add New Product**: Use FAB (+) button to create new products through 6-step wizard
3. **Edit Existing Product**: 
   - Tap the "Edit" button on any product card
   - Navigate through 2-step editing process
   - Review and update product details and pricing
   - Confirm changes to update the product
4. **Delete Product**: Tap product card and confirm deletion through dialog

#### Registration Flow
1. Launch the app (starts with Login screen)
2. Tap "Sign up" to navigate to Registration
3. Fill all required fields:
   - First Name and Last Name
   - Valid email address
   - Phone number (10-15 digits)
   - Address
   - Date of Birth (tap field to open date picker)
   - Password (minimum 6 characters)
   - Confirm Password
4. Tap "REGISTER" to create account
5. Successfully registered users are redirected to Login

#### Login Flow
1. Enter registered email and password
2. Tap "LOGIN" for standard authentication
3. **OR** tap "Use Biometric Authentication" for biometric login
4. Successful login displays welcome message

#### Biometric Authentication
- **First-time setup**: System automatically detects if biometric is available
- **Supported methods**: Fingerprint, Face recognition, Iris (device dependent)
- **Fallback**: If biometric fails, user can proceed with password login
- **Device compatibility**: Automatically hides biometric option if not supported

## Security Features

### Data Storage
- **DataStore Preferences**: Secure local storage for user data
- **No Plain Text Storage**: Passwords stored as-is (as per requirements - no encryption needed)
- **User Session Management**: Persistent login state

### Biometric Implementation
- **AndroidX Biometric**: Latest biometric authentication library
- **Hardware Detection**: Automatic detection of biometric capabilities
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all biometric scenarios
- **Permissions**: Proper biometric permissions in manifest

### Form Validation
- **Email Validation**: Pattern-based email validation
- **Password Strength**: Minimum length requirements
- **Phone Number**: Regex-based phone validation
- **Required Fields**: All fields validated before submission

## Screen Compatibility

### Responsive Design
- **Multiple Screen Sizes**: Optimized for phones and tablets
- **Orientation Support**: Portrait and landscape modes
- **ScrollView Implementation**: Ensures content accessibility on smaller screens
- **Material Design**: Consistent UI across different devices

### iOS Development Notes
Since this is an Android application, for iOS development you would need:
- **Flutter Alternative**: Consider Flutter for cross-platform development
- **Native iOS**: Swift/Objective-C implementation
- **Biometric**: Use TouchID/FaceID APIs on iOS
- **Keychain**: iOS equivalent of Android DataStore

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Registration with valid data
- [ ] Registration with invalid data (error handling)
- [ ] Login with registered credentials
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials
- [ ] Biometric authentication (if available)
- [ ] Navigation between Login/Register screens
- [ ] Form validation for all fields
- [ ] Date picker functionality
- [ ] Screen rotation handling

### Device Testing
- Test on devices with/without biometric hardware
- Test on different screen sizes
- Test biometric enrollment scenarios

## Known Limitations

1. **Backend Integration**: Currently uses local storage only
2. **Password Encryption**: As per requirements, no encryption implemented
3. **Biometric Enrollment**: Cannot enroll biometrics from app (system level)
4. **Network Operations**: No network calls implemented yet

## Future Enhancements (Part 2)

- Backend API integration
- Product listing and management
- Shopping cart functionality
- Payment integration
- Push notifications
- Advanced search and filtering

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Biometric not working**: 
   - Check device settings for biometric enrollment
   - Verify app permissions in device settings

2. **Build errors**:
   - Clean and rebuild project
   - Invalidate cache and restart Android Studio

3. **Navigation issues**:
   - Ensure navigation graph is properly set up
   - Check fragment lifecycles

## Contributing
